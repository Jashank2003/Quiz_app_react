# MidNightTrivia - Quiz Application

MidnightTrivia is a full-stack quiz application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It fetches quiz questions from the Open Trivia DB API and allows users to select various categories and difficulty levels. The application is responsive, designed for all screen sizes, and hosted on both Render (for the backend) and Vercel (for the frontend).

## Important Notes

- Due to Render's policy for free-tier users, the backend server may occasionally go dormant after a period of inactivity. When this happens, there might be a 
  delay 
 in starting the quiz while the server wakes up. If you encounter this issue, you can simply reload the app or try again after a few moments.
 I am currently exploring other hosting solutions to avoid this delay and ensure a smoother user experience.
